Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository locally:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Aryan03Pandey/Catalix-Assignment.git

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm or yarn:
Using npm:


npm install
 or
Using yarn:

yarn install


Running the Application:

Start the development server:
Using npm:


npm run dev

Using yarn:

yarn start

This will start a local development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser. You can view the React application running based on the Figma design.

Code Structure:

The React components and stylesheets are organized within the src folder. The main application entry point is likely index.js located at the project root. Explore the codebase to understand how the UI is built using React components and styled with Vanilla CSS classes.

Using the Figma Design:

Refer to the provided Figma design file (not included in this repository) for the visual reference and specifications of the UI. The React components and CSS styles should map to the elements and styles defined in the Figma design.

Additional Notes:

Feel free to modify the code to experiment and enhance the UI functionality.
